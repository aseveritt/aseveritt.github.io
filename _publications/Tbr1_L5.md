## [General Summary]
In mice, if you reduce the amount of a particular gene, _Tbr1_, at a specific time the brain does not form layers as expected and some neurons look and act differently (when compared to mice with normal levels of this gene). However, if you increase the amount of another associated gene, _Wnt7b_, some of these problems are less severe. This is particularly interesting because in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), _Tbr1_ is commonly a gene that is mutated and doesn’t work properly. Although many hurdles remain before rational therapies for ASD patients exist, this study is an import first step.  

## [Summary]
This study explores a how conditional deletion of mouse _Tbr1_ in cortical layer 6, at a developmental interval roughly equivalent to human mid-fetal stages, alters neuronal identity and function in homozygous and heterozygous mutants. _Tbr1_, a transcription factor, is a high-confidence autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk gene that affects the expression of several other ASD-associated genes. Therefore, it is an intriguing target for exploring changes in gene expression, synaptic activity and morphology, and behavior upon mutation.  Although previous work has investigated changes with homozygous mutations or deletions, there is less known about the effects of a heterozygous deletion late in gestation. 

Results indicate that _Tbr1_ heterozygous mutant neurons take on a hybrid layer 5 and layer 6 identity based on their gene expression profile, dendritic pattern, and physiology. Gene expression data (RNA-seq and ISH) denomstrates _Tbr1_ promotes expression of layer 6 markers and represses expression of layer 5 identity regulators. Apical dendrites in wild-type controls extend to layer 4 by P3; however, in _Tbr1_ homozygotes extension occurs to layer 1 by P3 and _Tbr1_ heterozygotes show extensions to both layer 1 and layer 2/3 by P3. Neurons from both the _Tbr1_ heterozygous and homozygous mice have reduced excitatory and inhibitory synaptic density as well as spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). Restoring expression of Wnt7b (a direct _Tbr1_ target) largely rescues the reduction in both excitatory and inhibitory synapse numbers in vitro and in vivo. 

Currently, there are no effective somatic treatments for most core deficits of ASD. More broadly, there are no current treatments for neuropsychiatric illness in humans that restore normal biology. The ability to successfully restore synapse numbers by expressing _Wnt7b_ may provide a possible avenue to restoring synapse numbers in humans with _Tbr1_ mutations using small-molecule _WNT7B_ agonists. In short, these observations provide an important initial step in conceptualizing rational therapies for ASD patients, although critically important hurdles remain.
