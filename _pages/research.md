I am currently a Bioinformatic Programmer III in Jeremy Willsey's lab at The University of California, San Francisco. 
I completed a BSc in Biotechnology in 2017 from the University of California, Davis.

Currently, my research focuses on combining the molecular landscape of human brain development with the genetics underlying 
autism spectrum disorder in an effort to disentangle the fundamental biology. To address this question the lab uses a 
variety of traditional biology approaches like genetic manipulations (CRISPRi) and model organisms (NPCs, frogs). 
However, because human brain development is inherently convoluted we also utilize many system biology approaches involving 
network construction and proteomics. 

I'm also a member of The Carpentries, a non-profit community-driven organization focused on teaching coding and data 
science skills.

Previous research projects include: 
  * the genetic basis of insecticide resistance and vector competence in malaria-transmitting mosquitoes
  * metatranscriptome profiles of the human gut microbiome
  * metagenomic analyses of aquatic plants
