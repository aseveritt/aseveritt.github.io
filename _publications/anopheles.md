## Abstract
The significant P450-related insecticide resistance observed in the 2014 An. coluzzii colony indicates
that ITNs treated with the P450 inhibitor piperonyl butoxide (PBO) would be more effective in this region. The
known insecticide resistance gene CYP6Z1 was differentially expressed exclusively in the context of sublethal
permethrin exposure, highlighting the importance of tissue-specificity and environmental conditions in gene
expression studies. The increased activity of the carboxylesterase COEAE5G in the resistant An. coluzzii colony
suggests resistance to other insecticides like organophosphates. Additional gene expression studies involving other
tissues (e.g. fat body) would provide a more comprehensive view of genes underlying metabolic insecticide
resistance in An. coluzzii from Mali. Identifying genetic markers linked to these regulatory alleles is an important
next step that would substantially improve insecticide resistance surveillance and population genetic studies in this
important vector species.
