## Abstract
An understanding of how heterozygous loss-of-func- tion mutations in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk genes, such as TBR1, 
contribute to ASD remains elusive. Conditional Tbr1 deletion during late mouse gestation in cortical layer 6 neurons 
(Tbr1 layer 6 mutants) provides novel insights into its function, including dendritic patterning, synaptogenesis, 
and cell-intrinsic physiology. These phenotypes occur in heterozygotes, providing insights into mechanisms that 
may underlie ASD pathophysiology. Restoring expression of Wnt7b largely rescues the synaptic deficit in Tbr1 layer 6 
mutant neurons. Furthermore, Tbr1layer6 heterozygotes have increased anxiety-like behavior, a phenotype seen ASD. 
Integrating TBR1 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from layer 6 
neurons and activity of TBR1-bound candidate enhancers provides evidence for how TBR1 regulates layer 6 properties. 
Moreover, several putative TBR1 targets are ASD risk genes, placing TBR1 in a central position both for ASD risk and 
for regulating transcriptional circuits that control multiple steps in layer 6 development essential for the assembly 
of neural circuits.
